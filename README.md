## Asteroid Clustering and Classification

### Overview

**Asteroid-Clustering** is a comprehensive project focused on the classification and clustering of asteroids using various techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and K-Means. This project delves into predicting asteroid hazards, identifying influential features such as Minimum Orbit Intersection and Absolute Magnitude, and uncovering unique cluster characteristics.

### Project Highlights

1. **Classification Techniques**: The project employs a range of classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, to categorize asteroids based on their features.

2. **Clustering Analysis**: Utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm, the project groups asteroids with similar characteristics into clusters, providing insights into the underlying patterns within the asteroid dataset.

3. **Feature Importance**: The project identifies and analyzes influential features, such as Minimum Orbit Intersection and Absolute Magnitude, to understand their impact on predicting asteroid hazards.
